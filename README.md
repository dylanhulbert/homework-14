I created the contents of this repo as homework for my Bootcamp at UofO

## Homework 14: Budget Tracker
The objective of this homework was to create a [PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application) that allows for offline access and functionality.

Similar to [Homework 13](https://github.com/dylanhulbert/homework-13), the application uses automatic deployments on commit via [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and a sandbox MongoDB db resource on [MLab](https://www.mlab.com/).

11/28/20 - Updated MongoDB location, from mLab to [Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).
